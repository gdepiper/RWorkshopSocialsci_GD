# Mid-Atlantic Fishery Management Council Request:
<br />

<br />
## [A conceptual model for summer flounder fishery-ecosystem interactions, inventory of data availability and gaps, applicable models, and example management questions which could be addressed with this knowledge base.](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html)

Transition from risk assessment to Management Strategy Evaluation

Credit where credit is due: Sarah Gaichas at NEFSC developed most of the R Markdown code & made the conceptual model interactive

# Orientiation

## What this talk will do:

- Walk through decision points which facilitated use of R & R Markdown

## What this talk won't do:

- Review every line of code used to develop the HTML file

  + That code can be found here: <br />
    https://github.com/gdepiper/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models.git
    
- Serve solely as an introduction to R Markdown

  + Better resources available
  
      + e.g. https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html
    
## The hope is to present the utility of collaborating in R, particularly for projects with ill-defined needs and products, necessitating substantial collaboration, or with recurring production needs.

In this interactive circular graph visualization, model elements identified as important by the Council (through risk assessment) and by the working group (through a range of experience and expertise) are at the perimeter of the circle. Elements are defined in detail in the last section of [this page](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_riskfactors_subplots.html). Relationships between elements are represented as links across the center of the circle to other elements on the perimeter. Links from a model element that affect another element start wide at the base and are color coded to match the category of the element they affect.Hover over a perimeter section (an element) to see all relationships for that element, including links from other elements. Hover over a link to see what it connects. Links by default show text for the two elements and the direction of the relationship (1 for relationship, 0 for no relationship--most links are one direction).For example, hovering over the element "Total Landings" in the full model shows that the working group identified the elements affected by landings as Seafood Production, Recreational Value, and Commercial Profits (three links leading out from landings), and the elements affecting landings as Fluke SSB, Fluke Distributional Shift, Risk Buffering, Management Control, Total Discards, and Shoreside Support (6 links leading into Total Landings).

# Collaboration facilitated through GitHub

[GitHub is integrated into RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html)

- Allows version control
  
  + Everyone works off of the same version of the code
  
    + Including all files needed to create products
  
  + Ensures the code can always be reverted to a point at which it worked
  
- GitHub will also host your web pages for free!

  + [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
  
  + Code pushed to site, and with some file folder housekeeping, HTML is rendered
  
    + Near-real time product updating
  
    + Warning: Not intuitive for those unfamiliar with HTML

# Ease of customization for alternate needs

[Presentation of the results of the work group to the MAFMC used different visual representation of the conceptual model](https://gdepiper.github.io/Summer_Flounder_Conceptual_Models/sfconsmod_final_2col.html)

Allowed work group to walk through top 3 questions with visual representation to discuss relevant ecosystem linkages.

FYI - the Council chose question 3 to develop a Management Strategy Evaluation around. Work is currently underway.

## Added benefits of using R and R Markdown

      + Frequent requests for information

      + Alternative text for 508 compliance (HTML)

# In Conclusion...

R and R Markdown are great resources, particularly for:

- Recurring reporting needs

- Collaboration

- Projects with undefined products

However, there's still value in other software/languages
